Friendlypodder, A friendly podcasting client
============================================

What is Friendlypodder?
-----------------------
Friendlypodder is a podcatcher, there is tons of them out there, but I'm just
trying to make one that fits what I like, and I'm just giving it out to see
if there is anyone else that likes it the same way.

First of all, it's command line, and it stores data in text files, I've taken
a bit of inspiration from bashpodder, but I like to have a bit more output when
I run the podcatcher, so I have added something that is more or less eyecandy
or a tiny bit of statistics porn if you will.

Friendlypodder also uses utf8 for some characters, so it might be that it
doesn't play too well with your terminal emulator, but if you're willing to 
change it, you can use urxvt, roxterm or whichever else terminal that you like
the best that has supports utf8/unicode

How do I use Friendlypodder?
----------------------------
This is pretty simple really, first thing, go to friendlypodder.conf and look
a bit into it, it should be rather self evident how it works, but here's the
format:
[Podcast name] http://feed.comes.here

Even if you're just testing out, it would probably be the best to look into the
file and delete some of the podcasts that I've added, there is quite a bit of
them in there, so it can be quite a lot of episodes getting downloaded if you
don't.

Next smart step will be to run Friendlypodder with the catchup argument so that
you don't get all the episodes that is in the feed. If there are any of the
episodes that you want to download you can just go to the log directory and
to the file that matches your podcast, and then delete the url of the
episode(s) that you want to get downloaded
It's smart to do this step every time that you have added a new podcast to the
config file.
Tips: you can use c instead of catchup if you don't want to write that much

Then we're finally ready to do the normal run, the way that you probably will
run it the most, you run it without arguments, or with download or d to go
through all the rss feeds and download the episodes that are new.
Don't worry, it will add the episodes that it has downloaded to the log so that
you won't download the same episode a lot of times.

If you use friendlypodder from another directory than the one it's in, you can
add the config file as ~/.friendlypodder.conf so that you won't get the
config file missing, the podcasts will still be downloaded in the working
directory

Why did I start Friendlypodder?
-------------------------------
Friendlypodder is more or less my first little python project, and it's for me
to try and get a bit used to programming in python with a small simple project,
So don't shoot me if something's not right, or not optimal, I'll try and do my
best to make it something that I can use myself at least

What is coming up? / Roadmap
----------------------------

There are some things that I want to add when I get some more time,
some of which are:

- Adding podcasts from the program, so that you don't have to edit the
textfile if that's how you want it

- Catching up to all episode except the newest

- Maybe some way of making records of statistics, like Mb downloaded and times
ran and so one

- Checking of the config file, to make it easier to find errors

- Making the program not having to have http:// in all the rss feeds

- Use argparse for parsing args

- Check for errors

- Fix problems with downloading on slow connections

- change to pycurl for downloading?

- make converter for conf file to convert to bp.conf (bashpodder)

- fix spinners that keep on getting everywhere (need to find help with the
threading issue there

- add friendlypodder remove, to remove a podcast from the conf file

- add function so you can decide where to download the podcasts too

And there is probably tons more that can be done, but that I don't know, I'm
open for suggestions and help, but I'm just starting out, so I'm not sure if
I will be able to make your grand plan come true, or that I will find it being
something that I want to add, but then you can make it yourself:) That's the
nice thing about the GPL, you don't even need to ask for permission ;)

I hope you will enjoy it :)
